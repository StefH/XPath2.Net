For test modules-none, the query has

import module namespace none="http://www.w3.org/TestModules/none" at "empty-lib.xq";

while the catalog has

<module namespace="http://www.w3.org/TestModules/test1">empty-lib</module>

I think the test driver is entitled to expect that the module namespaces imported by the query are the same as those named in the catalog. I think this is an error in the catalog, and I propose to fix it by changing the catalog to say

<module namespace="http://www.w3.org/TestModules/none">empty-lib</module>

Looks like this is fixed.
